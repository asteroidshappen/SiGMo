# SiGMo

SiGMo is the **Si**mple **G**alaxy **Mo**del written by Pascal Ulrich Förster (github: @asteroidshappen) at University College London. It can be used to simulate the evolution of populations of galaxies and their respective halos over cosmic time.

## This version: 0.2

The current version 0.2 is an operable developer version, but not release-worthy yet. Details about how to get started and an overview over the available classes and routines will be added at a later point, closer to the first major release.
